The Draw Steel Module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop is an independent product published under the DRAW STEEL Creator License and is not affiliated with MCDM Productions, LLC. DRAW STEEL Â© 2024 MCDM Productions, LLC.

## Installation Instructions
Based on the work haezan and AmbyNavy have done on the MCDM Discord, this module is very much in a Work in Progress state. You can install this by pasting the following URL into the Manifest URL box in the Install Module dialog in the setup menu of Foundry VTT.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiregor/Draw-Steel-Module/refs/heads/main/module.json

You can also manually install it by downloading the zip folder of this git repository and extracting it to `Data/systems/draw-steel-module`.

## Alternative Solutions
If you'd rather a fully developed Game System rather than a few content modules for the Custom System Builder, @MetaMorphic-Digital has an in-development project to fully implement the Draw Steel system over at https://github.com/MetaMorphic-Digital/draw-steel.
